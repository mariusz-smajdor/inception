[www] 
# This section defines the configuration for the PHP-FPM pool named "www".

user = www-data 
# The user under which the PHP-FPM processes will run.
# www-data is a common user for web server processes to ensure limited privileges.

group = www-data 
# The group under which the PHP-FPM processes will run.
# Matches the group used by web servers like NGINX or Apache for compatibility.

listen = wordpress:9000 
# The address and port on which PHP-FPM will listen for incoming FastCGI requests.
# "wordpress" is the hostname defined in Docker networking, and "9000" is the port used.

pm = dynamic 
# The process manager mode:
# - 'dynamic' allows PHP-FPM to scale processes dynamically based on demand.

pm.start_servers = 6 
# The number of PHP-FPM processes to start when the service initializes.
# Suitable for medium-sized traffic.

pm.max_children = 25 
# The maximum number of child processes that can be created to handle requests.
# This caps the memory and resource usage, ensuring stability.

pm.min_spare_servers = 2 
# The minimum number of idle (spare) server processes to maintain.
# Helps handle unexpected spikes in traffic quickly.

pm.max_spare_servers = 10 
# The maximum number of idle (spare) server processes to keep.
# Prevents over-allocation of resources when traffic decreases.
